# Investing Oracle

A Python-based stock analysis tool that calculates intrinsic value estimates for companies using historical earnings data and Phil Town's Rule #1 investing principles.

## Features

- Scrapes the **Nasdaq-100** companies from Wikipedia.
- Retrieves historical **EPS data** (e.g., from MacroTrends).
- Calculates:
  - **EPS CAGR**
  - **Future EPS**
  - **Estimated future stock price**
  - **Sticker price** (discounted intrinsic value)
  - **Margin of safety price**
- Fetches current stock price using `yfinance`.
- Filters companies that are trading below their margin of safety.
- Outputs results to CSV files for further analysis.

## Output Files

- `nasdaq_intrinsic_values.csv`: Full dataset with calculated values.
- `undervalued_companies.csv`: Companies trading below margin of safety.

## Requirements

pip install the following:

pandas

requests

beautifulsoup4

yfinance

tabulate

## Methodology
The approach is based on Phil Townâ€™s "Rule #1" investing strategy, which focuses on buying great companies at attractive prices based on conservative growth estimates.

## Various
Be a bit patient when using get_nasdaq_companies_and_eps.py as it will take
50 minutes to complete. The reason is that there is a nasty 15 wait there
between the calls to get the EPS because without it, the site blocks access.
